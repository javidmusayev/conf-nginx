# Purpose of this repo
Configure Nginx as reverse proxy for containerized applications with SSL termination and etc.

# Step 1
## Run Nginx in named docker container
`docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --network=userdefined -v "/etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt" --name nginx nginx`

We need *userdefined* network for connecting to backend applications (containers) by their name (applications' containers should be in the same network).
We need volume (*-v* argument) for mapping automatically generated LetsEncrypt certificates (they will be generated by **certbot** in another container) to Nginx directory.
